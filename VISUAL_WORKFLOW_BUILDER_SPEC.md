# Visual Workflow Builder - Detailed Feature Specification

## 1. Overview

The Visual Workflow Builder is a core feature of JustFlow, providing users with an intuitive, drag-and-drop interface to design, create, and manage their workflows. The goal is to simplify the process of automating and streamlining business processes.

## 2. User Stories

*   **As a Project Manager,** I want to create a new workflow from scratch so that I can define a custom process for my team.
*   **As a Team Member,** I want to view an existing workflow to understand the steps involved in a process.
*   **As a Project Manager,** I want to add different types of nodes to my workflow, such as "Action", "Condition", and "Trigger" nodes, so that I can create complex and powerful automations.
*   **As a Project Manager,** I want to connect nodes with drag-and-drop arrows to define the flow of the workflow.
*   **As a Project Manager,** I want to edit the properties of each node (e.g., the specific action to take, the condition to check) so that I can customize the workflow to my needs.
*   **As a Project Manager,** I want to save and version my workflows so that I can track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.
*   **As a Project Manager,** I want to validate my workflow to ensure that it is logically correct and has no errors before I activate it.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Canvas and Grid

*   The builder will provide an infinite canvas with a grid background for placing workflow nodes.
*   Users can pan and zoom the canvas.

### 3.2. Nodes

The builder will support the following types of nodes:

*   **Trigger Node:** The starting point of a workflow.
    *   Examples: "When a new task is created", "On a schedule (e.g., every Monday at 9 AM)", "When a webhook is received".
*   **Action Node:** A step in the workflow that performs an action.
    *   Examples: "Send an email", "Create a new task", "Assign a user to a task", "Call an external API".
*   **Condition Node:** A node that splits the workflow into different branches based on a condition.
    *   Examples: "If task priority is 'High'", "If task status is 'Done'".
*   **Delay Node:** A node that pauses the workflow for a specified amount of time.
*   **End Node:** The end point of a workflow or a branch.

### 3.3. Node Properties

*   Each node will have a set of configurable properties.
*   A side panel will open when a node is selected, allowing the user to edit its properties.
*   For example, an "Action Node" for sending an email will have properties for the recipient, subject, and body of the email.

### 3.4. Connections

*   Users can connect nodes by dragging from an output port of one node to an input port of another.
*   Connections will be represented by arrows.
*   The builder will validate connections to prevent invalid workflows (e.g., connecting an output to another output).

### 3.5. Workflow Management

*   Workflows can be created, saved, and deleted.
*   Workflows will have a name, description, and a status (draft, active, inactive).
*   The builder will provide a "Validate" button to check for errors in the workflow logic.

## 4. UI/UX Wireframes

(This section would typically contain visual mockups or wireframes. As a text-based AI, I will describe the UI instead.)

*   **Main View:** A two-column layout. The left column will contain a list of available nodes, and the right column will be the main canvas for building the workflow.
*   **Node Palette:** The left column will have a searchable palette of nodes, grouped by type (Triggers, Actions, Conditions).
*   **Canvas:** The main area where users can drag and drop nodes from the palette and connect them.
*   **Properties Panel:** A panel that slides in from the right when a node is selected, allowing the user to configure the node's properties.
*   **Toolbar:** A toolbar at the top of the canvas with buttons for "Save", "Validate", "Zoom In/Out", and "Center Canvas".

## 5. Data Models

(This section would define the data structures for workflows, nodes, and connections. I will provide a simplified version.)

```json
{
  "workflow": {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "status": "draft" | "active" | "inactive",
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "string",
        "type": "trigger" | "action" | "condition" | "delay" | "end",
        "position": { "x": "number", "y": "number" },
        "properties": {
          // Node-specific properties
        }
      }
    ],
    "connections": [
      {
        "sourceNodeId": "string",
        "targetNodeId": "string"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
